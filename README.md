This is a sample project with a react front end and Java REST API's on the back end.  The app runs on two EC2 servers, the first hosting the React front end, and the second serving the Java REST API's.

React, Bootstrap, Google's address verification API, Java REST API's and SQL database.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The client uses react for the UI, bootstrap for styling, and axois for REST API calls.  

The server uses Java Spring Boot for the REST API's and Google's address verification API.  The database is mySQL hosted in AWS.
